Financial Forecasting â€“ Recursive Function  
  
Recursion  
 => Recursion is a programming technique where a method calls itself repeatedly to solve smaller subproblems of a larger problem.
 => It continues until it reaches a base case that stops the recursion.  
 In this assignment, recursion was used to simulate compound growth by calculating future financial values year by year.

Complexity Analysis:  
 => Time Complexity : O(n), where n is the number of years  
 => Space Complexity : O(n), due to recursive stack calls  
 Each recursive call represents one year of forecasting, and the process continues until the base case is reached.

Optimization:  
 In problems with overlapping computations (like Fibonacci), recursion should be optimized using:
 => Memoization (store already computed values)  
 => Iteration, which avoids extra stack usage
